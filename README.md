# boost-cpp-mobile
Build scripts to bundle Boost C++ for iOS and Android.

This project just combines existing iOS [1] and Android [2] Boost C++ build scripts. Lates builds will be pushed here:
https://github.com/benstadin/boost-cpp-mobile-dist

I created this project because it took me some time to find up-to-date (and working) build scripts and pre-build libraries and franeworks of a same Boost version with same components. 

If you just want current and like versions (with same components compiled in) of Boost for your iOS or Android project and don't want to spend your day with building Boost on your own, just grab a release bundle from boost-cpp-mobile-dist linked above.
